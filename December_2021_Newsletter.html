            <img style="padding-right: 8px" src="Images\barrier gates.jpg" align="left" width="100px">
            <p>If you have very recently received a new barcode for your vehicle, and it does not work at the Eagleton back gate - <strong><font color="red">we apologize.</font></strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>The back gate barcode reader is updated in realtime whenever the PGA POA issues a new barcode - but that update relies on a working Comcast Internet connection from the PGA POA office to the back gate.
            <br><br>
            <p>Comcast replaced a faulty modem at the back gate on Tuesday of this week, but on Thursday morning the new modem failed as well.
            <br><br>
            <p>We have elevated this problem to high levels of management at Comcast, but we are still waiting for them to respond and replace or repair the faulty modem - once again.
            <br><br>
            <p>Please keep an eye on the sidebar of the Championship website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.championship-poa.com">(championship-poa.com)</a>. We will post an update there as soon as Comcast informs us that the problem has been corrected. </p>

            <h4>
            <font color="green"><font size="4px">COMCAST PILLARS</font></font>
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>
            In our last newsletter we noted that Comcast would be sending out a letter to those homeowners who had not yet switched from copper wire to fiber optics.</i>
            <br><br>
            <img style="padding-left: 8px" src="images\pillar.jpg" align="right" width="100px">
            The article indicated that the switchover was FREE.
            <br><br>
            Comcast tells us that the letter has now been sent. However, in the fine print at the bottom we noticed the following statement from Comcast:
            <strong><font color="red">"Free installation expires on 1/1/2022"</style=></font></strong>
            <br><br>
            The letter also confirms that <i>"If you do not schedule an appointment for a technician to connect your home to Xfinity fiber, all your Xfinity services will be disconnected when the current network is deactivated."</i>
            <br><br>
            So, if you are one of those homeowners who has NOT made the switchover from copper cable to fiber optic, PLEASE contact Comcast as soon as possible so that you do not lose service in the early part of the new year, or have to pay a conversion fee. <strong>The Comcast number is (800) 934-6489.</strong>

            <font color="green"><font size="4px">SIDEWALKS/BICYCLES/MOTORIZED VEHICLES</font></font>
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>As we get further into “season,” we are seeing increased numbers of homeowners and their guests arriving in PGA National. People are walking, riding their bicycles, and enjoying our great Florida winter weather.<br><br>
            <strong>We are however concerned  about safety on both our roadways and our sidewalks. We don't want to see anyone getting injured.</strong><br><br>
                        <img style="padding-right: 8px" src="Images\bikes.jpg" align="left" width="280px">
            It’s important to note that sidewalks are considered a “shared surface” and are for the use of both pedestrians and human powered bicyclists. However, per PGA rules, no motorized equipment such as scooters, electric bikes or golf carts are permitted on any sidewalks. The only exceptions to this are motorized handicapped equipment (i.e., wheelchairs) and maintenance personnel with their carts while in the course of their duties.<br><br>
            Several homeowners have inquired about adding bike lanes on roads such as Avenue of the Masters and Ryder Cup Boulevard. The Northern Palm Beach County Improvement District, (npbcid.org) who owns and maintains those roadways, has advised that bike lanes can not be added because it would require that they be added to both sides of the roadway, and the right-of-way on those roads is not wide enough.<br><br>
            <strong>So please,</strong> if you are walking, walk on the sidewalks. If you are human power bicycling on the sidewalks, do so cautiously and make your approach known to pedestrians. If you are riding a scooter or electric bike, you need to do so very carefully on the roadways. Golf carts are only permitted on the roadways if they are “street legal.”  Street legal golf carts need to have a Florida Department of Motor Vehicles license plate issued to the owner and affixed to the vehicle. <strong>Golf carts are never allowed on the sidewalks of PGA National and only on any PGA National roadway if they are a licensed motor vehicle.</strong><br><br>
            <strong><font color="red">Help keep PGA National –  yourself, fellow homeowners, and guests – safe as you enjoy your time here in Sunny Florida.</strong>
<!-- 
Fla. Statute 316.2065 (9) A person propelling a vehicle by human power upon and along a sidewalk, or across a roadway upon and along a crosswalk, has all the rights and duties applicable to a pedestrian under the same circumstances.

Fla. Statute316.2065 (10) A person propelling a bicycle upon and along a sidewalk, or across a roadway upon and along a crosswalk, shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian and shall give an audible signal before overtaking and passing such pedestrian.

Bicycles can be legally operated on all Florida sidewalks and crosswalks unless a local ordinance prohibits it.  When on a sidewalk, the operator is operating a vehicle and must use helmets and lights when required, and is subject to the DUI laws.  Otherwise, the operator has the rights and duties of a pedestrian, but must yield to all pedestrians.
