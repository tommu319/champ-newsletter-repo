            <h4>
            <font color="green"><font size="4px">COMMUNITY SWIMMING POOL SAFETY</font></font>
            </h4>
            <br />
            <img style="padding-left: 8px" src="Images\pool.jpg" align="right" width="180px">
            <p>It recently came to our attention that the gates of some of our community pools were being blocked open in order for landscapers and other contractors to have access to restrooms.
            <br><br>
            <p>While each of the pools in Eagleton are individually managed by their respective HOAs, the overall safety in the community comes within the purview of the Championship POA.
            <br><br>
            <p>With drowning being a leading cause of death of young children in Florida and a significant cause of death for medically frail elderly persons in Florida, we want to do everything we can to prevent such a serious and/or deadly incident from ever happening in Eagleton. Ensuring that entry to our community pools is restricted and that young unaccompanied children and the elderly can not gain access is <strong>critical to pool safety.</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>We have instructed the roving PGA Security Patrols to be particularly observant of the gates to all of our pools and, should they find them blocked open in any way, to immediately secure them and make a full report. We have also advised the various Management Companies that blocking gates open, either by their staff or their contractors is NOT an acceptable practice.
            <br><br>
            <p>As residents you are equally responsible for insuring that open access to the pools is never allowed.  When you enter or leave, please be sure the gate is closed and locked behind you. If you see a gate blocked open in any way, please remove the block and immediately notify Security <strong>(561 627-1600)</strong>. If you are unable to remove the block from the gate, notify Security and they will send a Patrol Officer to assist. <strong>Please <font color="red">do NOT leave</font> until the Officer has arrived. </strong>
            <br><br>
            <p><strong>The safety of our children, grandchildren, and our guests and visitors children is of vital importance to the overall Community. <font color="red">Please do your part.</font></strong></p>
            </p>
            </p>

            <h4>
            <font color="green"><font size="4px">SAFE COMMUNITIES</font></font>
            </h4>
            <h5><font color="red">While we are on the subject of safety and security...</font></h5>
            <br />
            <p>The Championship Property Owners Association (CPOA) has several responsibilities within the overall Eagleton community. These include such things as landscaping and irrigation on both Championship Drive and General Drive, the sidewalks, pavement, and lighting on both of those roadways as well as the bulk cable contract that supports each of the nine Eagleton communities and their respective Homeowners Associations (HOAs).
                <br><br>
            <img style="padding-left: 8px" src="Images\svc.jpg" align="right" width="180px">
            <p>The most important responsibility of the CPOA however is the security of our homeowners, their homes, and their guests. We take that responsibility very seriously and are continually striving to maintain and improve the safe environment in which we all live.
                <br><br>
            <p>Following the lead of local communities such as Old Palm, Lost Tree Village, Trump National Golf Club, the Bear's Club, Eastpoint Country Club, Frenchman's Reserve, the Palm Beach Polo Club and others, the Championship Board has approved a proposal from <i>"Safe Communities LLC"</i> to implement their <i>"Vendor ID Program"</i> within Eagleton. The program is designed to help prevent recently convicted burglars, thieves, sex offenders, violent felons, habitual offenders, and other career criminals from working in our community.
                <br><br>
            <p><i>Safe Communities LLC</i> runs a background check and driver's license check on all vendors wanting to work in the community. If they meet the criteria established by Safe Communities and agreed to by the Championship Board they are issued a digital Safe Communities Vendor ID (sample shown) which they then present each time they come to our Eagleton gatehouse.
                <br><br>
            <p>The Safe Communities Vendor ID program is FREE to both our community and to individual homeowners and has three major benefits:
            <div class="tab40" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;border-width:0;padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:0px;margin-left:40px;" >
            <ul>
            <li>It reduces the opportunity for homeowners to be victims by preventing known criminals from working in the community.</li>
            <li>It identifies individuals who have a valid driver's license and precludes those who do not have one from operating a motor vehicle on the roadways within Eagleton.</li>
            <li>It reduces lines in the visitor lane at the gatehouse by utilizing a QR code on the vendor's ID to expedite vendor entry</li></ul></div>
                            <br>
            <p>In addition, when a resident has a guest or family member who will be visiting for an extended period, a barcode can be texted to the guests before they even arrive in PGA National. That barcode can then be shown to the gate officer upon arrival at the gate to facilitate and speed up entry.
                <br><br>
            <p>The overall benefit for our community is to provide peace of mind and tangible proof, from an independent third-party, that vendors working in or around our homes have had a criminal background check and driver's license check within the past 12 months.
                <br><br>
            <p>We anticipate this program will "Go Live" on or about March 1, 2022, as it will take that amount of time to install the hardware and software, train the gatehouse personnel, and inform vendors of the new protocol. Surveys in other communities, such as those mentioned above, show that typically 46% or more of the vendors currently working in the community already have a Safe Vendor ID. In fact, there are currently over 47,000 vendors, from over 8,000 different Florida companies, enrolled in the Safe Vendor ID system.
                <br><br>
            <p>In the upcoming months we will be providing you with additional information on how the system will work and answering any questions you may have. We also encourage you to visit the Safe Communities website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.safevendor.net">www.safevendor.net</a> to learn more about the Safe Communities Vendor ID program.
